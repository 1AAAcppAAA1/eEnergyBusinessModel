//High energy consumption for cryptocurrency mining is the main slow down for crypto mining. The miners suppose an enormous energetic cost for his work due to the complex mathematical calculations that have to utilize the processors. The life of cryptocurrencies is directly linked to electricity.

It is a fact that in some countries that are rich in coal and oil, energy becomes cheaper by burning polluting fuels and causing more pollution and in turn a greater demand causing CO2 emissions to increase.

At eEnergy we have a solution. Our goal, which we will meet, is to create a solar photovoltaic pool, capable of generating an ever increasing amount of power to supply the mining farms. With the continual growth model in solar and crypto mining we can keep a long term strategy in flux with growth making the mining sustainable and profitable, without the need for common electricity.

eEnergy uses only clean energy and production is 100% free of CO2.\\
